# TOP-Recipes
This project is a part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. It's a project created only with the sole purpose of practicing all of the HTML knowledge that I have acquired throughout the course.

In this project, a main index page will be there which will have links to some recipes.

So far, I am enjoying the journey. Though I have done various front-end projects during my internship before which was completed four months ago, I want make my foundations in web development strong.

I have learned some new concepts while taking my Odin Project Journey. I learned how to install and run linux os on my windows os  more specifically  Xubuntu using virtualbox. I got familiar with a lot of basic linux commands as well as git, the importance of good commit messages.
